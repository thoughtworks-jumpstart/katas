## Minesweeper Game

Practice both OOP and TDD with a minesweeper kata!

The games is played on a M by N grid of `cells'. Your task (should you choose to accept it) is to locate all of the mines without causing any of them to explode.

Besides knowing that there is a grid of cells, you have zero information about the cells. Each cell could be empty or contain an explosive mine. You can only `reveal' the contents of a chosen cell, one at a time. Should you reveal a mine, the game is over and you have lost. If, however, you reveal an empty cell, the following will happen:

1. The program will indicate how many of the revealed cell's eight neighbours do contain mines.
1. Any neighbouring empty cells will also be revealed in the same way.

If you are smart enough, these should provide you with enough information to determine where the mines are hidden. You win when the number of unrevealed cells is equal to the number of mines on the board.
